# Naan Recipe

This naan bread is fluffy, bubbly, and chewy – perfect for Indian curries or eaten plain! Makes 6 small naans (~15-16cm diameter).

## Instructions

1. **Bloom yeast**: Mix yeast with warm water and sugar in a small bowl. Cover with cling wrap, leave for 10 minutes until foamy.

2. **Egg and milk**: Whisk milk and egg together.

3. **Flour**: Sift flour and salt into a separate bowl.

4. **Add wet ingredients**: Make a well in the flour, add yeast mixture, and butter and egg mixture. Mix together with a spatula. Once the flour is mostly incorporated, switch to your hands and bring it together into a ball. No kneading is required.

5. **Proof 1**: Cover the bowl with cling-wrap, then leave in a warm place for 1 - 1.5 hrs until it doubles in size.

6. **Cut into 6 pieces**: Place the dough on a lightly floured surface. Cut into 6 equal pieces, then shape into balls into spheres with a smooth surface by stretching the surface and tucking it under.

7. **Proof 2**: Place balls on a lightly-floured tray or plate. Sprinkle lightly with flour, cover loosely with a lightweight tea towel. Put in a warm place to rise for 15 minutes until it increases in size by about 50%.

8. **Roll out**: Place a round on a lightly-floured work surface, flatten with your hand. Roll out into 3 - 4mm thick rounds (about 16cm wide).

9. **Heat skillet**: Rub a cast iron skillet with a very light coat of oil using 2.5 ml oil on a paper towel. Set over high heat until you see wisps of smoke.

10. **Cook naan**: Place a naan dough in the skillet and cook for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes until the underside is deep golden / slightly charred – the surface should get bubbly. Flip then cook the other side for 1 minute until the bubbles become deep golden brown.

11. **Cook remaining naan**: Remove, set aside, and repeat with remaining naan, taking care to regulate the heat of the skillet so it doesn't get too hot.

12. **Finishing**: Brush freshly cooked naan with melted butter or ghee (or garlic butter). Sprinkle with nigella seeds and coriander. Serve hot!

### Cheese Naan

1. Roll out a naan per above directions. Brush with plain butter or garlic butter.

2. Place a mound of cheese in the middle - about 60g, lightly-packed. Bundle it up, money bag-style, then twist to seal.

3. Turn upside down so the smooth side is up. Roll out to 6-7mm thick rounds.

4. Heat a well-seasoned cast iron skillet preheated over high heat, but not until the skillet is smoking. Cook naan for around 1 1/2 minutes on the first side until golden – it will puff up! Turn and cook the other side for around 45 seconds.
