# Chicago Style Hot Giardiniera

Based on Adam Witt's "Italian Beef Sandwich 2.0", this giardiniera is the great equalizer—a cheap jar of oil-soaked heat and crunch that turns a simple sandwich into something unforgettable.

## Instructions

### Day 1: Brining

1. **Prepare Veg**: Dice the cauliflower, celery, carrots, and serrano peppers into a large dice.
2. **Brine Calculation**: Add the cut vegetables to a large container and cover with water. Record the weight of the water and vegetables in grams. Multiply this weight by **0.08** (8%) to get your salt measurement.
3. **Salting**: Add the calculated amount of Kosher salt to the water and stir to incorporate.
4. **Rest**: Cover and let sit at room temperature overnight.

### Day 2: Pickling

1. **Drain & Weigh**: Place a large bowl on a scale and zero it out. Drain the salty brine into the bowl to measure its weight, then discard the brine.
2. **Make Pickling Liquid**: In a medium saucepan, combine a fresh mixture of liquids equal to the weight of the drained brine: use **50% water and 50% distilled white vinegar**.
3. **Add Seasonings**: Add the sugar, dried thyme, dried oregano, chili flakes, and garlic cloves to the liquid.
4. **Boil**: Bring to a light boil and simmer for 5 minutes.
5. **Combine**: Pour the hot pickling liquid over the vegetables in the large container.
6. **Cool**: Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for **3 days**.

### Day 5: Finishing

1. **Strain**: Strain the vegetables and discard the pickling liquid.
2. **Chop**: Add the pickled vegetables and the green olives to a food processor. Pulse to create a minced, "relish-like" consistency.
3. **Oil Pack**: Transfer the minced vegetables to a sealable container. Pour enough olive oil to completely cover the mixture.
4. **Store**: The giardiniera will last refrigerated for at least 2-3 months in a sealed container.

## Tips

- **Sugar Note**: While traditional fermentation might rely on natural sugars, adding a bit of sugar to the pickling liquid balances the sharp acidity and heat.
- **Serving**: Use a clean utensil each time you serve to extend shelf life.
- **Usage**: Essential for Italian Beef, but also amazing on pizzas, subs, eggs, or mixed into pasta salad.
