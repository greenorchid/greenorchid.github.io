# Winning the FiDA Foundry Hackathon: Empowering Users with AI-Driven Savings

Participating in the FiDA Foundry hackathon at Bank of Ireland was an exhilarating experience that culminated in our team, #MoneyBunny, taking home the top prize. As someone deeply passionate about leveraging technology for real-world impact, being part of this winning team was incredibly rewarding. It reinforced my belief that AI, when applied with thoughtful context, can truly empower users and drive meaningful change in financial services.

## The Challenge: Navigating Open Finance Overload

The hackathon focused on a critical truth in open finance: more data doesn't always lead to better decisions. While FiDA (Financial Data Access) empowers customers to share their financial information across banks, wealth management, insurance, and more on their terms, it can often result in information overload. Customers face FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and choice paralysis when confronted with endless options and "what if" scenarios.

This was the paradox we tackled—how to harness the power of aggregated financial data without overwhelming users. The goal was to create solutions that feel calm and reassuring, not smart for the sake of being smart.

## Our Solution: #MoneyBunny – AI-Powered Automated Savings

Our team embraced the rabbit theme wholeheartedly and developed #MoneyBunny, a concept that uses FiDA data to identify spending patterns and hidden inefficiencies. Instead of bombarding users with more choices, we designed an AI-driven system that quietly takes action on their behalf.

Key features include:

- **Spending Pattern Analysis**: Surfacing trends and inefficiencies in a digestible way.
- **Regret Reduction**: Addressing "what if I’d done X?" questions by showing actionable insights.
- **Automated Savings Steps**: Using AI to implement small, impactful savings actions without requiring constant user input.

The beauty of #MoneyBunny lies in its simplicity—less noise, fewer decisions, and more progress toward financial goals. It's AI that acts as a trusted companion, not a demanding advisor.

## Why This Work Feels Rewarding

Being part of the #MoneyBunny team was rewarding on multiple levels. First, witnessing firsthand how AI with context can solve real customer pain points was inspiring. We're not just building features; we're creating tools that genuinely improve lives by reducing stress and empowering better financial habits.

The collaborative environment at the hackathon, supported by Bank of Ireland's Lighthouse team and partners like Deloitte, Pegasystems, Forrester, and labb, fostered rapid ideation and execution. It was a reminder that innovation thrives when governance is thoughtfully balanced with creativity.

Moreover, the focus on customer-centricity resonated deeply. In an era where "personalized" often means more ads and nudges, #MoneyBunny represents decision relief—a shift toward solutions that prioritize user well-being over product pushers.

## Looking Ahead: The Future of AI in Banking

This experience has solidified my enthusiasm for AI's potential in banking. The next era won't be defined by flashy dashboards or endless recommendations, but by quiet, context-aware assistance that makes complex financial landscapes navigable.

As open finance evolves, initiatives like FiDA Foundry show how banks can transition from data hoarders to trusted filters. I'm excited to see where #MoneyBunny goes next and how it contributes to a calmer, more empowered financial ecosystem.

Participating in this hackathon wasn't just about winning—it was about being part of something that matters. Here's to more innovations that leverage AI to empower users, one automated savings step at a time.
