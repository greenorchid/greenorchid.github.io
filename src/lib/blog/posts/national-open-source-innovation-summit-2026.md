# Building Roads & Bridges: Open Source, AI, and Europe’s Innovation Future

**"Building Roads & Bridges"** — Clare Dillon’s opening keynote set a fitting tone for the National Open Source Innovation Summit 2026. Open source was framed not simply as a development model, but as shared digital infrastructure — connecting communities, organisations, regulators, and technologies across borders.

Hosted by the Open Ireland Network, the summit ([summit.openirelandnetwork.com](https://summit.openirelandnetwork.com)) brought together policy makers, technologists, and industry leaders to explore how open collaboration is shaping innovation across Ireland, Europe, and beyond. Across AI, regulation, OSPOs, procurement, and sector adoption, one message was clear: open source is no longer optional — it is foundational.

## Open Source and AI: Acceleration with Accountability

One of the strongest threads throughout the day was the growing intersection between open source and AI. Open models, shared tooling, and collaborative research are accelerating innovation at unprecedented speed. At the same time, speakers emphasised that openness must be paired with responsibility, governance, and trust.

Initiatives such as the OpenForum for AI and the Agentic AI Foundation were highlighted as emerging ecosystems helping to shape the next phase of AI development. These initiatives aim to provide shared standards, governance approaches, and community-driven frameworks that enable organisations to innovate responsibly while maintaining openness and interoperability.

Transparency, provenance, and explainability featured prominently — particularly as AI systems become embedded in critical services and infrastructure. Open source was consistently positioned as an enabler of trustworthy and auditable AI.

## Regulation as an Enabler, Not a Barrier

European regulation was another central focus, covering both existing frameworks and upcoming legislation impacting open source and AI adoption. Rather than being framed as a blocker, regulation was widely viewed as an opportunity to strengthen open source ecosystems.

Regulatory clarity encourages better software supply chain practices, improved security posture, and clearer accountability. Open collaboration models actively support compliance by providing visibility into code, development processes, and risk management practices. Across multiple sessions, the consensus was that regulation and innovation are not opposing forces when approached through open ecosystems.

## Trust, Evidence, and Cyber Resilience

A particularly strong alignment discussed at the summit was between the Trustable Software Framework (TSF) and emerging European regulation. The framework’s six evidence-born principles — Provenance, Construction, Changes, Expectations, Result, and Confidence — align closely with the intent and requirements of the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA).

Rather than relying on checkbox compliance, TSF promotes an evidence-driven approach to demonstrating software trustworthiness across the full lifecycle. Open source practices — transparent development, traceability, and community review — naturally support this model.

## Sovereignty, Cloud, and Europe’s Digital Future

Sovereignty was another recurring theme. The existing Cloud Sovereignty Framework (v1.2.1, October 2025) explicitly references sovereignty across control, transparency, and dependency management. Open source was repeatedly identified as a key enabler of sovereignty, helping reduce vendor lock-in while increasing verifiability and control.

This perspective strongly complements the direction of the upcoming EU Cloud & AI Development Act, where open ecosystems are expected to play a central role in enabling secure, sovereign, and interoperable digital infrastructure across Europe.

## Sector Innovation Through Open Collaboration

The summit also highlighted how sector-focused open collaboration is delivering real-world impact. OpenLogistics was presented as a strong example of how open standards, shared platforms, and cross-industry cooperation can address supply chain complexity, improve resilience, and enable interoperability.

These initiatives demonstrate how open source is evolving beyond software into shared industry innovation platforms — bringing together public sector, private industry, and academia to solve systemic challenges.

## OSPOs, Procurement, and Organisational Maturity

Several sessions explored the growing role of Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) as enablers of sustainable adoption. OSPOs were described as organisational connectors, aligning engineering, legal, security, and procurement teams around consistent strategy and governance.

Procurement emerged as a critical lever. Traditional models often struggle with open source realities, but organisations that adapt procurement approaches are better positioned to realise long-term value, sustainability, and vendor independence. The message was clear: successful open source adoption is as much organisational as it is technical.

## Financial Services and Open Collaboration

A standout panel explored how Financial Services organisations are engaging with open source to meet evolving software development needs. Topics included security, compliance, skills development, and balancing open collaboration with competitive advantage.

The discussion demonstrated that even in highly regulated environments, open source can deliver speed, resilience, and innovation when supported by strong governance and mature operating models.

## Conclusion

The National Open Source Innovation Summit 2026 reinforced that open source innovation is now defined by ecosystem collaboration. From AI and regulation to trust frameworks and sovereignty, open source is increasingly central to how Europe builds resilient, transparent, and future-ready digital infrastructure.

The roads and bridges are being built — across communities, sectors, and borders. The next challenge is using them effectively.

Thank you to all the speakers and participants for sharing their insights and experiences. I look forward to seeing what the future holds for us all in the world of open source innovation!
