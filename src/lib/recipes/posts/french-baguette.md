# Homemade French Baguette Recipe

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, add flour, yeast, and salt. Add room temperature water and stir until everything is just incorporated. It should still be sticky and there will be some flour showing in places.

2. Cover the bowl with a plate or plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.

3. Stretch and fold the dough at each "corner" (4 times total) and cover again for 30 minutes. Repeat that process twice more for a total of 3 stretch and fold sessions.

4. Transfer the dough to a clean bowl. Cover and keep it in the refrigerator overnight for 12-14 hours.

5. Transfer the dough onto a floured work surface, gently stretch it into a square, and divide it into 3 equal pieces.

6. Gently fold each piece in half, lengthwise, and let them rest for 45 minutes.

7. One at a time, place each portion on a floured counter with the seam running north-south. Fold the top half to the center and gently press. Flip over the dough and repeat the same process. Fold the dough in half again, along the same line, and gently seal the edge.

8. Roll the dough gently into a long piece, about 2.5-5cm in diameter. Repeat with remaining pieces.

9. Transfer the baguettes onto a parchment-lined baking tray. Rest for 30 minutes. Pre-heat your oven to 250°C. Fill a mist spray bottle with water.

10. Using a sharp knife or razor, score the surface of the baguettes several times, in your desired pattern.

11. Place the baking tray in the oven and spray the dough with water 3-5 times before closing the door. Bake for 17-20 minutes until deep golden brown.

12. Every 3-5 minutes during baking, spray into the oven above the dough about 5 times to create steam for the perfect crust.
