# Classic Pancakes

These fluffy pancakes are perfect for a weekend breakfast. The secret is to not overmix the batter!

## Instructions

1. **Mix dry ingredients**: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder.
2. **Combine wet ingredients**: In another bowl, beat the eggs, then add milk and melted butter.
3. **Combine**: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined - lumps are okay!
4. **Rest**: Let the batter rest for 5 minutes.
5. **Cook**: Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Pour 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake.
6. **Flip**: When bubbles form on surface and edges look dry, flip and cook until golden.

## Tips

- Don't overmix the batter - a few lumps make fluffier pancakes
- Let the batter rest for better texture
- Keep pancakes warm in a 200°F oven while cooking the batch

Enjoy with maple syrup, fresh berries, or your favorite toppings!
