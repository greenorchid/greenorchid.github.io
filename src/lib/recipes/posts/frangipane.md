# Classic Frangipane

This versatile, naturally gluten-free frangipane is the perfect filling for almond-based tarts, pastries, and Bakewells. This double-batch is ideal for a large tart or multiple smaller pastries.

## Instructions

1.  **Cream Butter and Sugar**: Cream together the softened butter and caster sugar until light and fluffy.
2.  **Combine Ingredients**: Gradually mix in the beaten eggs.
3.  **Finish Filling**: Fold in the ground almonds and almond extract until well combined and smooth.
4.  **Apply**: Spread the frangipane filling evenly into your prepared tart shell or over your pastry.
5.  **Topping**: Sprinkle with flaked almonds if desired.
6.  **Bake**: Bake according to your specific tart recipe (typically 20-30 minutes at 180°C–200°C) until the filling is set and the top is golden-brown.

## Tips & Notes

- **A note on "Wet" Ingredients**: If you are using this frangipane in a tart with particularly wet ingredients (such as pears or pples), **reduce the total volume of liquid (eggs/extract) by 15%** to ensure the filling sets correctly.
- **Gluten-Free**: This filling is naturally gluten-free. Ensure your chosen base or pastry is also gluten-free if required.
- **Variations**: You can substitute the almond extract with vanilla or even a splash of dark rum for a different flavor profile.
- **Bakewell Tart**: This recipe is perfect for a Bakewell Tart. Simply spread the frangipane filling evenly into your prepared tart shell or over your pastry. Top with flaked almonds if desired and bake until the filling is set and the top is golden-brown. A gluten-free shortcust pastry recipe (I use Odlums GF Plain flour) works really well.
